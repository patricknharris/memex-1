# memex-1

Memex conceptually cross-links all data into single compressed graph of indexes.
Searches against the Memex can be as simple as a keyword search or as complex as 

1) an entire article about a domain
2) an entire numerical vector representing on IOT sensor stream
3) combination of an analysis article and numerical vector representing on IOT sensor stream
4) combinations of sets of analysis articles and set of numerical vector representing all IOT sensors associated with an event, a route or a recipe

With the expectations that the search would return similar articles, similar numerical vectors, similar sets of articles and numerical vectors or combinations thereof, ordered by similariy.

The Memex utilities include:
1) ability to find reference articles
2) ability to find specific numerical profiles
3) ability to find specific reference articles pertaining to specific numerical profiles
4) ability to define, then reference article collections and corresponding collections of numerical profiles.

Some say that we already have such systems but the truth is that most modern data mining / ML pipelines at their very first step constrain result sets / analysis by some combination of filtering, averaging, linear trending or reduction in some way in order to constrain the computational complexity and avoid the so-called "curse of dimensionality" argument. 

For some domains, the reductionist principles enables sufficient fidelity to indicate the preferences for common consumable items like shoes, clothes and movie recommendations.  

For other domains like innvoative pharma or other similar moonshots that humankind is presently exploring within the domains of material sciences, energy, neuroscience, bio-physics, etc whereby common mathematics as expressed in statistics that depends on calculus and calculus depends on "smoothness" between adjacent numerics - does not actually hold up due to extreme non-linear, discontinuous space-time trajectories associated with the phenomena under study.
